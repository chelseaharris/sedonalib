This directory contains Python scripts for processing the CMFGEN data files into
an hdf5 format usable by Sedona. User should only need to edit and run two files.

First, run the "convert_database.py" script to convert the cmfgen data
into an hdf5 format. The cmfgen database can be obtained here:

     http://kookaburra.phyast.pitt.edu/hillier/web/CMFGEN.htm

Second, run "create_model.py" to build a model-specific hdf5 file that contains
only the data for a subset of the species available in the database.

Both of the scripts have various options that can be toggled; please consult their
docstrings for details.
